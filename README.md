## Documentations

### JQuery and Bootstrap

### Webcams
Two different webcams are used in this interface. 
* [RecordRTC](https://recordrtc.org/) is used for video recording throughout the entire process. 
* [Webcam JS](https://github.com/jhuckaby/webcamjs) is used for creating snapshots to be displayed. 

### Circular layout
[jQuery â€“ arrange items in a circle](http://www.connolly-technologies.com/jquery-arrange-items-in-a-circle/)
is used with parameters adjusted.

## Usage
Add your own `test.mp4` file to use the interface.

To disable the back button of the browser, the multiple pages are organized and fully controlled by the js file.
### Page 1: Basic information

### Page 2: Facial expressions

### Page 3: Tutorial
Tutorial video is displayed here.

A confirmation message appears before the test starts.
### Test pages
The test runs in the following cycle:

6 seconds of video -> 1 second break -> 3 second emotion selection -> ...

### End page
The json file with all user data is saved under `[MM][DD][Last name][The Initial of first name].json`.
An example would be `0801SmithP.json`:

## Unsolved Problems
RecordRTC provides a way to post the recorded video through `node.js` in [RecordRTC to Node.js](https://github.com/muaz-khan/RecordRTC/tree/master/RecordRTC-to-Nodejs), but I have not figured out how to implement this feature here.
